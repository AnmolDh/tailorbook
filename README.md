# TailorBook

TailorBook is a web application built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack that aims to provide a convenient online solution for managing tailor businesses. It serves as a digital register specifically designed for tailors, allowing them to manage customer orders, measurements, and other business-related tasks in an efficient and user-friendly manner.
